Atharo CLI
=================

Atharo CLI to build and deploy plugins.

# Installation

`$ npm i -g atharo-cli`

# Building a Plugin

To skip the explanations and just look at the code, check out the [examples](https://github.com/warent/atharo-cli/tree/main/plugins/examples).

Then use `$ atharo deploy` to deploy your plugin.

## Overview

Atharo plugins are serverless functions that add to the capabilities of ChatGPT. The details of how it works with ChatGPT are not important to build for Atharo, but more information on that is available in their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).

## Configuration

Every plugin begins with an `atharo.yaml` file, which describes what the plugin is and what its features are. We describe the plugin and its features using plain english.

For example, a plugin for getting the weather might look like:
```yml
version: 1
name: Atharo Weather Demo
description: A demo of Atharo that gets the weather
features:
  weather:
    description: Get the current weather in a given location
    example: What's the weather like in San Diego?
    entry: weather.ts
    parameters:
      - name: location
        description: The location to get the weather for
        type: string
        required: true
      - name: unit
        description: The unit to use for the temperature
        type: string
        required: false
        options:
          - celsius
          - fahrenheit
```

For more about what parameters mean, read on about the "Features".

## Features

Features are coded with [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as serverless functions. For example, a feature for getting the weather might look like:

```ts
// weather.ts

type Request = {
  location: string;
  unit: string;
};
type Response = {
  location: string;
  unit: string;
  temperature: number;
  forecast: string;
};
export function main(request: Request): Response {
  return {
    ...request,
    temperature: 77,
    forecast: "sunny",
  };
}
```

### Parameters

The values your function receives and returns are defined as the `parameters` of your feature in the `atharo.yaml` file.

The AI is intelligent enough to extract the necessary data from a user's plain english chat message and pass it as an object to your function.

For example, we see the `location` parameter is a required string, therefore you know the AI will always provide that to your function in its request object.

The paramters also define what the AI expects to receive in return. However, you do not have to define every aspect of your return object, because the AI is intelligent enough to infer what the return data means based on your description of the features.

For more specific details about how ChatGPT works with functions, you can read more in their [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).

## Deploying

Plugins are deployed using the `$ atharo deploy` command in the directory with the `atharo.yaml` file.

### How does this work?

First, the command uploads all of the files in that directory to the Atharo server. The Atharo server then registers the plugin in its database so that Atharo knows about it and users can enable it. Finally, it spins up a serverless Deno function to handle those requests from Atharo as users interact with your features.
